    <p>You may have heard our origin story before, but in case you haven't, or you want a refresher on the full story, here it is.</p>

    <p>We met in Portland in 2016 and now we're getting married. The end! Just kidding.</p>

    <p>Rachel and Michael met as all good millennial introverts do: algorithms. Rachel's online profile and general demeanor were both Extremely Cool and she refused to tell Michael which Masterpiece Theater show was her favorite. However, Michael was "relentlessly kind" and was able to coax her out of her shell by asking pointed questions about dumplings and not just sending a message like "sup."</p>

    <p>We got engaged in New Orleans in May 2019 and celebrated with four charbroiled oysters topped with crab meat and garlic butter. Then Rachel got a "Voodoo Daiquiri."</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Is this even still happening?</h3>
    <p>
Thank you so much for your patience as we continue to respond and adapt to the pandemic. We have decided to proceed with getting married on Saturday, June 5, 2021. However, we will be changing our wedding plans because your health and safety matter most to us.
</p>

<p>
To start, we have reduced our guest count. We are inviting guests in waves as we monitor our county's progress.
</p>

<p>Please be aware that we are asking all people who attend our wedding in person to take a COVID test the week of our wedding and, if they are traveling into Oregon to attend the wedding, to quarantine for at least seven days before the wedding per current state regulations. <strong>We plan to host a larger reception for everyone as soon as we are able, hopefully next summer.</strong>
</p>

<p><strong>Guests who have been fully vaccinated for at least 14 days prior to travel need a negative COVID-19 test but are not required to quarantine.</strong></p>

<p>
These changes deeply sadden us because we love you and miss you all, but as much as we want to start our marriage with you present, we want you to stay safe more.
</p>

<p>Thank you again so much for your love and support. This has been &mdash; and remains &mdash; an extremely difficult time and we so value all of the empathy and grace you have given us as we do our best to start our marriage in a way that doesn't endanger the lives of those we love best in the world.</p>

    <h3>How do I get to the venue? Can I park there?</h3>
    <p>The Victorian Belle is two blocks away from the Kenton/N Denver Ave stop on Portland's MAX Yellow Line and easily accessible from the North Columbia exit on I-5.</p>
    <p>Parking at the venue is extremely limited and will be reserved for family and vendors. We recommend taking the MAX Yellow Line or a cab. You can also roll the dice with street parking in the neighborhood if you like.</p>

    <p>
    <strong><em>FROM I-5:</em></strong> Take exit 305B from I-5 N to Lombard St. heading West. Make a right on N McClellan.
    The venue is the unmistakable big Victorian house on your right.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong><em>VIA THE YELLOW LINE:</em></strong> Take a Northbound MAX Yellow Line to Kenton/N Denver Ave. Walk 1 block to
    the east on N Willis Blvd, and one block south on N Interstate Pl. The venue is on the corner of N Interstate and
    N McClellan.

    <h3>How do I get around Portland?</h3>
    <p>
        Portland is easily navigable by car and we have yet to find any to-and-from trip that takes more than 20 minutes each way.
        Bus and MAX travel take a bit longer, but are also excellent options. Portland also offers a bike rental program called
        Biketown and if you are used to steering a boat of a Citibike, you'll be right at home on one of these. Our bike infrastructure
        is among the best, and June is a beautiful time of year here.

    <h3>I'm coming from out of town. Where should I stay?</h3>
    <p>
        If you are planning to stay in a hotel, you essentially have two options: downtown, or in Portland's Lloyd District. The former,
        on Portland's west side, puts you closer to standard downtown amenities such as The Fancy Mall and the Portland Art Museum, while
        the Lloyd District, on the east side, is closer to the Convention Center and a mall with an ice skating rink.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can personally vouch for the Hilton downtown and the Hotel Eastlund or Hilton DoubleTree in the Lloyd District. Both areas are served by the MAX Yellow Line which travels to the venue, mentioned above.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you're looking for a "Portlandia"-type experience, the Jupiter Hotel is right in the middle of Inner Southeast, where you can get doughnuts covered in cereal and such.
    <p>

    <p>
        If you are planning to book lodging through Airbnb or Vacasa and would like our thoughts or recommendations on a neighborhood, please
        get in touch.

    <h3>What should I wear?</h3>

    <p>
        This is not a black tie event, but you can't wear sweatpants either (not sorry, you just can't!) - does that help?
    </p>

    <p>
        Rachel is describing attire as "croquet party chic." Michael describes it as "probably the nicest party you'll attend in 2021,
        don't waste the opportunity."
    </p>


    <h3>I heard you are both vegetarians now. Does this mean you'll only be serving crudit&eacute;s?</h3>

    <p>
        No, you can have meat if you want it. Vegan and vegetarian options will be available. Everything will be tree-nut free, for the bride's enjoyment.
